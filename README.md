Final Project for COEN352. Compares two input texts, a dictionary and a text file. When a word present in the dicitonary is found in the input text, the frequency of that word is incremented. 

Appologies for the very messy (and poorly commented code), I discovered a large bug a day before the deadline and had to rework most of the project.
